It is used to invoke functionalities of a contract and can be left empty or bytes(0) for regular value transfers. Remember that invoking SC functions is just a regular transaction containing the relevant calldata. Calldata is obtained by encoding the desired function's signature and its parameters, but fortunately web3 libraries already do the heavy lifting for you, so no need to do this manually. The recipient address needs to be the address of the Smart Contract whose method you want to invoke.\n",
